# hello-world
"This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow."
My name is Jay Cline, I am 41 years old and I am attempting to go back and do what I had always wanted to as a kid. First thing is trying to finish college and receive my degree in computer science and computer applications. 
I currently live in Rohnert Park California. Just recently moved out here in November, but Im well on my way to learning to code and hopefully find work doing what i enjoy doing!
